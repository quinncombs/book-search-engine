# book-search-engine

## Description
This project started as a fully operational Google Books API application using RESTful API, and it has now been refactored using GraphQL and Apollo Server. This application utilizes the MERN stack with MongoDB, React, Express and Nodejs.

## Usage
With this application you can search for any books using the Google Books API. You do not need to be logged in to search a book,  but when you are, you can save books and a page will show all saved books and include information and the link to its Google Books site. There is also a sign out button.

The instructions were as follows:

1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

4. Deploy your application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas. Use the [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) walkthrough for instructions.
